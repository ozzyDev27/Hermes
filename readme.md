This is a deprecated language.  
It was originally designed for ZoOS, to be a native language that runs on the ESP32.  
Then I thought "what if i just use C"  
And so, now, if you want to code using ZoOS, you shall use C.  
  
I might update this later, because I really am quite fond of the grammar I designed.
